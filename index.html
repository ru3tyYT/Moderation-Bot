        </ul>
        <h2>10. Warranties, Disclaimers, and Limitation of Liability</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>The Software is provided "as is" without warranties of any kind. To the maximum extent permitted by law, the authors, maintainers, and contributors disclaim all implied warranties, including merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement.</li>
          <li>In no event shall the authors, maintainers, or contributors be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, or consequential damages arising from the use of or inability to use the Software, including damages for lost profits, data, or other losses.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>11. Indemnification</h2>

          <li>These Terms are governed by the laws of the jurisdiction indicated in the repository or the applicable governing law if you deploy the Software in a different jurisdiction. Disputes shall be resolved in the appropriate courts of that jurisdiction.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>14. Severability</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>If any provision is found unenforceable, the remaining provisions remain in effect.</li>
        </ul>

    <section id="privacy" class="section" aria-labelledby="privacy-title">
      <h1 id="privacy-title">Privacy Policy (Moderation Bot)</h1>
      <p>This Privacy Policy describes how the Moderation Bot project collects, uses, stores, and safeguards information when you run or participate in the project. It also explains your rights regarding data processed by the Software and how to exercise them. If you do not agree with the policy, do not use the Software.</p>

      <div class="card">
        <h2>1. Scope and Definitions</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>This policy applies to data collected by or through the Moderation Bot project when deployed by you or by contributors using the Software. It covers data that the Software processes locally on your environment and any optional telemetry you enable.</li>
          <li>For the purposes of this policy, “Data” means any information processed by the Software, including content to be moderated, logs, configuration data, and telemetry (if enabled).</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>2. Data We Collect ( configurable )</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>If telemetry is enabled, we may collect anonymized usage statistics such as feature usage, command counts, error rates, and version information. Telemetry is designed to be non-identifying and is configurable by environment variables.</li>
          <li>Logs: The Software may write logs containing timestamps, event types, and moderation decisions or events when configured to do so by you. Logs may include content excerpts that are necessary for debugging or auditing moderation actions. Logs are stored locally on your system unless you configure external logging services.</li>
          <li>Configuration: The Software stores configuration settings, including moderation rules, pattern files, adapters, and integration endpoints. This data is typically stored in files in your deployment environment.</li>
          <li>System Information: Basic system information (e.g., OS, architecture, software versions) may be collected to aid debugging and compatibility reporting.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. How We Use Data</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Telemetry (if enabled): To improve the Software, identify usage patterns, fix bugs, and plan feature development. Telemetry data is anonymized and aggregated.</li>
          <li>Logs: To debug issues, audit moderation actions, and improve the Software. Logs should be secured and access-controlled.</li>
          <li>Configuration and System Data: To ensure compatibility and correct operation within your deployment environment.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. Data Retention</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Telemetry data is retained for as long as configured by your environment or until you disable telemetry.</li>
          <li>Logs are retained according to your retention policy in your environment. We recommend setting a retention period aligned with internal policies and legal obligations.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>5. Data Sharing and Disclosure</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>The Software does not send data to external services by default. If you configure external services or third-party adapters, data may be transmitted to those services in accordance with their privacy policies.</li>
          <li>We do not sell Data. We may disclose Data to law enforcement or legal requests as required by applicable law, or as necessary to protect the rights, property, or safety of you or the project.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>6. Security</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Data stored in your deployment is governed by your own security controls. Local access controls, encryption at rest in your environment, and secure transport where applicable are recommended.</li>
          <li>We aim to implement reasonable security measures to protect Data in transit and at rest where the Software itself stores Data, but there is no guarantee of absolute security.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>7. Your Rights</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>You may access, correct, delete, or export Data you have provided or generated in your deployment, subject to your environment’s capabilities and legal requirements.</li>
          <li>If you enable telemetry, you may opt out or disable it entirely. You can also adjust log levels and retention policies.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>8. International Data Transfers</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>If you deploy the Software outside your home jurisdiction, ensure compliance with local data transfer laws. The Software itself does not automatically transfer Data to external servers unless you enable telemetry or connect to external services.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>9. Cookies and Tracking</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>The Software does not set web cookies unless you configure a web interface or dashboard. In such cases, cookie usage is governed by that interface’s privacy practices.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>10. Children’s Privacy</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>The Software is not intended for use by children under the age of 13. If you operate a deployment with users under applicable minimum age, you should implement appropriate controls to prevent data collection from those users.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>11. Data Controller and Contact</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>If you have questions about data practices, contact the project maintainers via the repository’s issue tracker or the contact channels listed in the repository.</li>
        </ul>
